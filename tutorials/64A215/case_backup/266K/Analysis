Case 1 :
[Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model]

1) Boundary condition
U : freestream
p_rgh : freestream pressure

Rest of scalar field
: fixedValue/uniform value

2) Result

- Resolution of p_rgh is diverged.
- Unreasonable pressure field was obtained.
- Thus, rest of scalar field which is closely affected by pressure, could not be obtained.

3) Treatment

- Boundary condition for 'massBuoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoam' set to 'freestream' is not suitable.
  [probably]
- Other boundary condition should be used which is forcefully set by users.



Case 2 :
[kOmegaSST turbulence model]

1) Boundary condition
U : fixedValue with uniform stream velocity
p_rgh : fixedValue with uniform pressure value

Rest of scalar field
: fixedValue/uniform value.

2) Result

- Resolution of p_rgh was converged.
- Reasonable pressure/velocity field was obtained.
- Vapor contaminent field was formed into a thin layer and seemed liked to be affected by the velocity field.
- Finally, rest of scalar fields which is closely affected by pressure and velocity, were reasonably obtained.

4) Temporal conclusion

- If freestream boundary condition is necessary, current freestream boundary condition libararies should be
  modified into the suitable form for 'massBuoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoam'.
- If other boundary condition can be reasonable and used, freestream boundary condtion is then no longer determined.
